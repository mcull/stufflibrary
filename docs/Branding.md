# StuffLibrary Branding Guidelines

This document captures early design decisions for StuffLibrary’s identity.  
The goal: **trustworthy utility with a touch of mid-century warmth.**

---

## Wordmark

- **Primary logo:** Text-only wordmark, “StuffLibrary.”
- **Type direction:**
  - Sans serif: Geometric, modern (e.g. Futura, Avenir Next).
  - Serif accent: Optional, for headings/captions (e.g. Source Serif).
- **Visual motif (future):** Stamp or card-corner shape (evokes library cards).

---

## Color Palette

- **Ink Blue (primary):** `#1E3A5F`
- **Warm Cream (background):** `#F9F5EB`
- **Mustard Yellow (accent option 1):** `#E3B505`
- **Tomato Red (accent option 2):** `#D1495B`
- **Soft Gray (neutral):** `#E0E0E0`
- **Charcoal (text):** `#333333`

Usage:

- Blue = trust, anchors wordmark & headers.
- Cream = backgrounds, evokes paper/postcards.
- Red/Yellow = accents for CTAs, playful emphasis.
- Gray/Charcoal = structure and legibility.

## Tone

- **Plainspoken utility** (Craigslist, not corporate SaaS).
- **Neighborly warmth** (welcoming, not preachy).
- **Playful nods to mid-century school/library aesthetics.**

---

## Homepage Guidelines

- **Hero headline:** “The things you need might already be on your street.”
- **Subhead:** “StuffLibrary helps neighbors share what they already own. Borrow tools, gear, and more—without the awkwardness of asking or the expense of buying.”
- **CTA:** “Join the waitlist.”

---

## Future Media

- **Video concept:** 1950s educational filmstrip style (cheerful narrator, oversimplified animations).
- Script centers on: many lawnmowers → one lawnmower shared → neighbors smiling.
- Closing card: “Share more, buy less.”
