# Onboarding: Accounts, Branches, and Invites

This document defines how new users join StuffLibrary, create or join branches, and invite others.  
It should feel **safe, playful, and familiar** — more like getting a real library card than creating another app account.

---

## Accounts (Master Identity)

- Each person creates a **StuffLibrary account** (their global identity).
- Account contains:
  - Name (first + optional last initial)
  - Avatar (photo or illustration)
  - Basic contact info (email and/or phone, never public by default)
  - Master Card (their global trust profile)
- Account = one person → multiple branches possible.

---

## Branches

- A **branch** is a shared library of stuff (e.g. a neighborhood block, friend group, or club).
- Anyone can create a new branch.
- Branch setup:
  - Name (e.g. "Oak Street Library")
  - Location (optional, if neighborhood-based)
  - Rules (borrowing limits, deposit requirements, care guidelines)
- Each branch issues **Branch Cards** to its members.

---

## Joining a Branch

Options for joining:

1. **Invite Link**
   - Creator/admin can send a private invite link (email, SMS, messenger).
   - Clicking the link = apply for a branch card.
   - Branch admins approve or auto-approve depending on branch rules.

2. **Postcard Invites (Delightful Option)**
   - User can choose “Invite my neighbors” → StuffLibrary prints and mails postcards to N neighbors (e.g. 5 on each side).
   - Postcard includes:
     - Short explainer (“Your block has a shared library of stuff”)
     - QR code invite (geo-fenced to that street).
   - Ensures even without emails/phones, neighbors can join safely.

3. **Nearby Discovery (Optional)**
   - Branches with location enabled can appear in a **“near me” search**.
   - Users can request to join, but need approval.
   - For safety, discovery is opt-in at branch level.

## Library Cards

- **Master Card:** issued at account creation.
- **Branch Cards:** issued per-branch, once invite accepted.
- Cards track:
  - Borrowing rights
  - Local trust/reputation
  - History of activity

---

## Safety Considerations

- No one sees your address or contact info until you lend/borrow.
- Branch creators must approve new members (unless auto-approve is explicitly enabled).
- Geo-fenced postcard invites help ensure authenticity.
- Reputation and trust systems (see `TrustSystem.md`) create long-term safety nets.

---

## Design Goal

Onboarding should feel like:

- **Delightful ritual** (getting your first library card, receiving a postcard).
- **Ultra-safe** (no exposure to randoms, clear trust boundaries).
- **Frictive in a good way** (slight ceremony adds weight, reduces abuse).
