# Jobs To Be Done (StuffLibrary)

This document outlines the core functional and emotional "jobs" that StuffLibrary fulfills for users.  
These jobs are the guiding principles for product design and feature prioritization.

## Core Jobs

1. **Borrow without awkwardness**
   - When I need an infrequently used item,
   - I want to see if someone nearby has it available,
   - So I can avoid buying one and feel resourceful without imposing.

2. **Lend without stress**
   - When I have stuff that sits unused most of the year,
   - I want to make it visible and lendable in a controlled way,
   - So I can reduce waste, justify keeping it, and feel generous without feeling exposed.

3. **Belong to a branch/community**
   - When I join my neighbors or friends on the platform,
   - I want to feel like I’m part of a defined group with norms,
   - So I can trust people, know expectations, and avoid random strangers.

## Emotional Jobs

4. **Signal trustworthiness**
   - When I borrow or lend,
   - I want my care and reliability to be visible,
   - So I can build a reputation and know others will do the same.

5. **Rediscover neighborliness**
   - When I use the app,
   - I want it to feel like a playful, safe, familiar ritual (like old library cards),
   - So I can reconnect with neighbors and reduce suburban anonymity.

## Functional Jobs

6. **Track who has what**
   - When I lend something,
   - I want to see who has it and when it’s due back,
   - So I can keep peace of mind without spreadsheets or nagging texts.

7. **Reduce duplication & cost**
   - When my block/friends all need an item,
   - I want to see what’s already in circulation,
   - So I can avoid everyone buying their own.

## Design Implication

- Core jobs (1–3) define **MVP features**.
- Emotional jobs (4–5) inspire **delightful design metaphors** (cards, stamps, postcards).
- Functional jobs (6–7) add **utility and structure** as the product matures.
