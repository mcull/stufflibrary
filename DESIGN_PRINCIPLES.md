# Design Principles for StuffLibrary.org

These principles guide all design and development decisions.

## 1. Safety is the first feature

Trust is earned by making people and their property feel secure.

- Clear identity verification
- Transparent histories of care
- Strong defaults for privacy

## 2. The brand recedes

StuffLibrary is a civic utility. It should feel like infrastructure, not a startup.

- Neutral, plain language
- Accessible design over flashy branding
- Functionality over ornament

## 3. The commons can thrive

Inspired by Elinor Ostrom’s 8 principles for governing shared resources:

- Boundaries matter (neighborhood-level groups)
- Rules fit local needs (configurable by community)
- Monitoring and reciprocity are built in
- Sanctions are gentle but present
- Conflict resolution is simple and quick
- Communities can organize themselves
- External recognition strengthens legitimacy

## 4. Start general, specialize later

The base platform serves all “stuff.” Verticals (e.g. camera gear, tools) can emerge as special cases once the core is solid.

## 5. Delight through generosity

Small touches—thank-you notes, “well cared-for” badges—reinforce that sharing is rewarding, not burdensome.

These principles are not static. They evolve as the community learns how StuffLibrary is used and what neighbors need.
