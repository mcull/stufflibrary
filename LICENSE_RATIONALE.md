# Why We Chose AGPLv3

StuffLibrary.org is a civic project, not a startup. Our mission is to help neighbors share more and buy less by making borrowing safe, simple, and trustworthy. Because the project is about building _commons_, we want to make sure the codebase itself remains part of the commons.

## Why AGPLv3?

We chose the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)** because it ensures:

- **Transparency** – Anyone running or modifying StuffLibrary must share their changes if they make it available to others over the network.
- **Reciprocity** – Improvements made by one community flow back into the shared code, so no one can “privatize” the commons.
- **Fairness** – A company can’t simply take StuffLibrary, rebrand it, and lock it away behind closed code or ads. If they profit from it, their improvements come back to everyone.

## Why not MIT/Apache?

- MIT and Apache licenses are permissive, which encourages adoption—but also allows others to close off or exploit the code without sharing improvements.
- For a community-driven project like StuffLibrary, we believe that risks undermines the mission.

## Why not GPLv3?

- GPLv3 ensures open sharing of derivative works, but doesn’t cover network use. With GPL, someone could run StuffLibrary as a hosted service, make changes, and never contribute them back.
- AGPLv3 closes that loophole.

## In Short

AGPLv3 keeps StuffLibrary.org a true public good: open, transparent, and community-owned. It protects the code from enclosure while allowing wide adoption by individuals, nonprofits, and communities who share our values.
