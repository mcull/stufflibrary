    question: 'What if something gets damaged or lost?',

    question: 'How much does it cost to use StuffLibrary?',
    answer:
      'StuffLibrary is free to use! We believe sharing should be accessible to everyone. We may introduce premium features in the future, but basic sharing will always be free.',

    question: 'What kinds of items can I share?',

    question: 'How do I arrange pickup and return?',
    answer:

  {
    question: 'What if I need something that no one has shared yet?',
    answer:
      "You can post a request describing what you need! Your neighbors will get notified and can offer to share if they have it. It's a great way to discover items you didn't know were available.",
  },

      "Once we launch in your area, simply sign up, verify your identity, and start browsing or sharing items. We'll send updates as we expand to new neighborhoods.",
