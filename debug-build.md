# Build Debug

This is a temporary file to force a fresh Vercel build.

## Components that should exist:

- src/components/AuthLayout.tsx ✓
- src/components/Wordmark.tsx ✓
- src/components/ProfileWizard.tsx ✓
- src/components/AddItemClient.tsx ✓
- src/theme/brandTokens.ts ✓

All files exist locally and are tracked by git.
Build works locally but fails on Vercel.
