# StuffLibrary.org

**Share more, buy less.**

StuffLibrary.org is an open-source platform that helps neighbors share under-used items safely and easily. Think: ladders, lawnmowers, camping gear—things we all own but rarely use. By treating neighborhoods as collective libraries, we can save money, reduce waste, and strengthen community ties.

## Mission
To make it natural and safe for neighbors to borrow and lend things, following principles of trust, accountability, and care.

## Core Values
- **Safety first** – people and property are protected by design.
- **Civic utility** – the platform recedes into the background like a public library or Craigslist.
- **Generosity** – small acts of care and reciprocity build long-term trust.

## Roadmap
- MVP: user accounts, neighborhood groups, item listings, borrow/return flow.
- Trust & Safety: verification, reputation, condition tracking.
- Community: acknowledgments, lightweight messaging, neighborhood stats.
- Future: verticalized libraries (e.g. LensLibrary), deposits, insurance pools.
