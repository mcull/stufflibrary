# Contributing to StuffLibrary.org

First off: thank you for caring about the commons. This project exists to help neighbors share more and buy less. Contributions—whether code, ideas, or documentation—help make that possible.

## Principles

- **Safety is the first feature.** Protect people and their property above all else.
- **Keep the commons open.** All contributions must align with our AGPLv3 license and the spirit of reciprocity.
- **Build civic utility.** Favor clarity and reliability over flash or gimmicks.
- **Iterate small.** Make changes in small, testable steps.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork & Branch**
   - Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`feature/add-item-schema`).
2. **Open an Issue First**
   - For new features or significant changes, open an Issue to discuss. Link your PR to the Issue.
3. **Write Tests**
   - Add or update tests for all new functionality.
   - Use Jest for JS/TS and Pytest for Python (where applicable).
4. **Documentation**
   - Update README, inline docs, or API reference if your change affects usage.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Keep PRs focused and small.
   - Explain the "why," not just the "what."
   - Reference related Issues.

## Code Style

- **Backend:** Follow PEP8 (Python) or standard linting configs.
- **Frontend:** Use Prettier and ESLint defaults. Keep components small and composable.
- **Commits:** Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).

## Issue Labels

- `backend`, `frontend`, `infra`, `design`, `docs`, `research`
- `good first issue` for approachable tasks
- `help wanted` for community needs

## AI Contributions

Claude and other coding assistants are welcome. Please ensure:

- Code is human-reviewed before merging.
- Generated code follows project style and includes tests.
- PR descriptions clearly note when code was AI-assisted.

## Community Standards

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Be kind, be constructive, and remember: this is about building trust.

**In short:** start small, keep it safe, document your work, and help the commons thrive.
